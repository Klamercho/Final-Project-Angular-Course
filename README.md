## :point_right: Project Introduction :point_left:

The following project contains a simple business website for a Business Process Outsourcing company. The company name is KLM. 

## :warning: How to load the backedn with sample data! 

Simply start the backend from the branch "Server". After the server is running on localhost:1234 go to these three links: 

http://localhost:1234/clients/initial       

http://localhost:1234/careers/initiatingData

http://localhost:1234/news/initiate

They contain pre-set data, which can be used as placeholder for future data. To create a new user, simply register using the register page. 

## :pencil: Project Description EN

KLM is a BPO company, which provides outsourcing solutions to businesses. It's website should communicate to the clients in a simple manner - what services are available, what KLM as a company values, as well as providing options for potential new recruits an insight into the company's open positions and culture. For potential recruits, there is the option to apply for a job within KLM, once they have registered on the website.
The website aims to keep the layout very simple. It has a navigation bar, contained in the header, as well as a footer containing details for the company and few useful links to the company's social media. Header and footer are available on every page (header is slightly changed for the home page). To improve user experience the website uses Angular animations and Angular Materials (for better looking forms, buttons and spinner). Below in the section "Features and Functionalities" is a more detailed log of everything currently available - function-wise on the website.
